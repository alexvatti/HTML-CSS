    <h1 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, make conclusions, and support decision-making. Data analysts use various techniques such as statistical analysis, data mining, and predictive analytics to generate insights from data.</p>

    <!-- Machine Learning Section -->
    <h1 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on datasets to recognize patterns and make informed predictions.</p>

    <!-- Deep Learning Section -->
    <h1 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h1>
    <p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to model complex patterns in large amounts of data. It is widely used in applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.</p>
